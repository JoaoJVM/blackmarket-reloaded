# blackmarket-reloaded

After the small success of Blackmarket, I decided to create a new Blackmarket incremental-game

This game is totally text-based, build with Bootstrap, Angular-JS, jQuery.

## Run the game locally.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` on the repo folder to install all Node dev-dependencies.
3. Run `bower-installer` to install all web-dependencies ([bower-installer](https://github.com/blittle/bower-installer) is an amazing tool to install bower dev-dependencies and don't include entire repos).
4. Start your CMD on the repo folder and emulate a local server with the command `http-server .` then go to `localhost:8080` on your browser (port 8080 by default).

## Wanna help?

Do you have ideas, code suggestion or other?

You can create an issue or fork (it's better!) the repo to suggest code changes.

When editing game files, run `grunt` command to optimize files changed.
